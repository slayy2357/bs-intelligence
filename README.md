## Trying to create an external AI that play brawl stars using internal functions of the game, jailbreak required
### Part 1 : make the AI to orient itself
#### Read the number of players left
- Able to read the number of players left (usually for showdown)

#### Get enemy coordinates in game (later)
### Part 2 : traffic
#### Dynamic analyse : POST requests (crypted)
crypted request example : [crypted-001.txt](https://github.com/slayy2357/bs-intelligence/blob/main/dump/requests/crypted-001.txt)  
If you change anything (for the joining request example) :

#### Decrypting traffic
- To decrypt requests, we first need to understand how the game encrypts them by analyzing the functions that call POST requests :
[backtrace-001.txt](https://github.com/slayy2357/bs-intelligence/blob/main/dump/requests/backtrace-001.txt)
- 101c13460 payload analyse :
[101c13460.txt](https://github.com/slayy2357/bs-intelligence/blob/main/dump/requests/101c13460.txt)  
So we need to focus on the data pointed by arg2 modifications BEFORE 101c13460 bcause already encrypted  
The best way to understand is probably here, backtracing and analysing, but later
- Analysing modules

CCSHA256 : error

CCCrypt  : 1 call :
```
[cccrypt-001.txt](https://github.com/slayy2357/bs-intelligence/blob/main/dump/requests/cccrypt-001.txt)
``` text
libboringssl.dylib
SSL_write          : 20+ call //interessant
SSL_read           : 20+ call, example when you look other profiles :
```
[ssl_read-001.txt](https://github.com/slayy2357/bs-intelligence/blob/main/dump/requests/ssl_read-001.txt)  
So, we can read some payloads before encryption through SSL_write, SSL_read, and CCCrypt, but those aren't the main payloads. What we want to intercept is the payload sent through the send function before encryption, as that's how the game communicates with the serverâ€”for example, when joining a game, using emotes, etc
- Strategy to read the payload of send BEFORE encryption
``` text
We know that:

The first requests are ALWAYS in the same order, for example:

request A
request B
Request A will ALWAYS be sent before request B, and the gap between their payload addresses in memory is ALWAYS the same. For example:

request A (0x100); // payload address
request B (0x200); // payload address
So, based on this, we can predict the address of payload B before it is created:

payload B = payload A + 0x100
This allows us to hook the address in memory before the payload is encrypted / writed to see which function or address writes the encrypted payload b.

For example, the memory where payload B will be written looks like this before encryption: 0000 0000 0000 0000.

We place a hook at this memory location.
The encryption function (e.g., 0x1c121e) writes to this location: 1010 1000 1010 1000.
BOOM, our hook is triggered, called by the encryption function at 0x1c121e.
```
Alright, I haven't found the encryption function yet, but now I'm able to read and modify every payload before encryption
#### Decrypted payloads analyses
(!) : Decrypted payloads are not necessarily readable. Decrypted means that the structure is logical and will be the same for all payloads

#### Payloads modifications tests
So, what we wan't to modify for example is this payload (the request when you join the training map with berry (black skin)) :
